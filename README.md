# EE541: Computational Introduction to Deep Learning
USC'Spring 2022

This Repository contains all the Models and Algorithms implemented during the semester as a form of assignments. Some are implemented from scratch using only Numpy, Scipy, MatplotLib and other Standard Python libraries. And some algorithms/models were implemented using Machine-learning Python Packages like Sklearn. In the later assignments, python framework PyTorch was used to implement, particularly Deep Neural Networks.
